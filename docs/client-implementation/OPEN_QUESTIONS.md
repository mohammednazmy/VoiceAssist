#### Q23: AI Diagnosis Liability ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Category:** AI & Machine Learning
**Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Legal/regulatory
**Decision Needed By:** Before any image analysis feature (Week 40)

**Question:**
What are the liability considerations for AI-assisted diagnosis? Should we pursue FDA approval?

**Background:**
Medical AI systems that provide diagnostic advice may be considered medical devices requiring FDA approval.

**Options:**

- **A)** Decision support only (no diagnosis claims)
  - **Positioning:**
    - "Educational and decision support tool"
    - "Not a substitute for professional medical judgment"
    - "Always verify with primary sources"
  - **Disclaimers:** Clear, prominent, require user acknowledgment
  - **FDA:** Not required for decision support
  - **Liability:** Lower risk
  - **Effort:** Legal review, disclaimers

- **B)** Diagnostic assistance with disclaimers
  - **Positioning:**
    - "AI-assisted diagnostic support"
    - Provides differential diagnosis suggestions
    - Confidence scores shown
  - **FDA:** May require 510(k) clearance (medical device)
  - **Liability:** Medium risk
  - **Effort:** 6-12 months FDA approval, $50k-200k

- **C)** Full diagnostic system (FDA-cleared)
  - **Positioning:**
    - "FDA-cleared diagnostic AI"
    - Direct diagnostic capabilities
  - **FDA:** Requires De Novo or PMA approval
  - **Liability:** Highest risk, highest value
  - **Effort:** 12-24 months, $200k-1M+

**Provisional Answer:**
**Strongly recommend Option A** (decision support only).

**Recommended Approach:**

1. **Position as decision support tool:**
   - "For educational purposes"
   - "Clinical decision support"
   - "Not for diagnostic use"

2. **Implement comprehensive disclaimers:**
   - On first use: User must accept terms
   - On every image analysis result
   - In footer of every page
   - In Terms of Service

3. **Clear user acknowledgment:**

   ```
   "VoiceAssist is a clinical decision support tool, not a diagnostic device.
   All AI-generated information should be verified with primary sources and
   should not replace professional medical judgment. By using this tool,
   you acknowledge that VoiceAssist is for educational and reference
   purposes only."
   ```

4. **Avoid diagnostic language:**
   - ❌ "Diagnosis: Melanoma"
   - ✅ "Possible findings: Pigmented lesion with asymmetry. Suggest dermatology referral."

5. **Always cite sources:**
   - Link to guidelines, literature
   - Encourage verification

**Legal Requirements:**

- [ ] Legal review of all AI features
- [ ] Terms of Service updated with disclaimers
- [ ] User acceptance flow implemented
- [ ] Professional liability insurance review
- [ ] Consult with FDA regulatory expert

**What We Need:**

- [ ] Legal review before Week 40
- [ ] Decision: Decision support only or pursue FDA approval?
- [ ] If FDA: Budget $50k-200k, timeline 6-12 months

**Impact:**
**If we pursue FDA approval:** 6-12 month delay, $50k-200k cost, but much higher value and trust.

**If we stay decision support:** Faster to market, lower cost, but cannot make diagnostic claims.
