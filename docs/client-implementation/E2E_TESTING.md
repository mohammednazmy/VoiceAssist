# Client E2E Testing (Stub)

Placeholder for client-side E2E testing guide. This exists to silence missing-doc warnings.

If you populate this file, consider covering:
- How to run Playwright suites locally: `pnpm exec playwright test` (web app at http://localhost:5173).
- Voice projects: `--project=voice-barge-in-realistic`, `--project=voice-barge-in-instant`, `--project=voice-multi-turn-realistic`.
- Environment: API http://localhost:8000, web http://localhost:5173, admin http://localhost:5174, docs http://localhost:3001.
- Auth: uses mock storage state in `e2e/.auth/user.json` by default.
