# Archived Summary Documents

This directory contains historical summary and completion documents that were created during the development process. These are preserved for reference but are **not maintained**.

## Why Archived?

These documents were primarily "celebration" or "completion tracking" documents that:

- Focused on what was done rather than how things work
- Contained redundant information now covered in canonical docs
- Added clutter to the main documentation

## Current Documentation

For current project status and technical information, see:

- **Implementation Status**: [overview/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md](../../overview/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md) - Living status document
- **Architecture**: [UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md](../../UNIFIED_ARCHITECTURE.md) - Canonical architecture reference
- **Start Here**: [START_HERE.md](../../START_HERE.md) - Project entry point
