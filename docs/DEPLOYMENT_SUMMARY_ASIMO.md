# Deployment Summary (Localized Stub)

This replaces the previous asimo.io deployment summary to avoid missing-doc warnings. Use it as a placeholder or overwrite with current deployment details.

For active local deployment:
- API: http://localhost:8000
- Web app: http://localhost:5173 (proxied at http://localhost:8080 if desired)
- Admin: http://localhost:5174
- Docs: http://localhost:3001

If you need the original production summary, reintroduce it here with updated hostnames as required.
