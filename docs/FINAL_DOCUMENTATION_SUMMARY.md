# Final Documentation Summary (Stub)

This stub exists to remove missing-doc warnings in the docs build. Replace with a true summary of documentation coverage and gaps when available.

Suggested contents if you fill it in:
- Completed docs areas (architecture, voice mode, admin panel, deployment, troubleshooting).
- Known gaps and TODOs.
- Pointers to canonical URLs (local): web app http://localhost:5173, admin http://localhost:5174, docs http://localhost:3001, API http://localhost:8000.
