# VoiceAssist Server - Environment Example
#
# This file exists primarily to satisfy tooling references in .ai/index.json
# and documentation. The canonical environment configuration for the running
# system lives at the repository root in `.env.example`.
#
# To configure the backend, copy the root `.env.example` to `.env` and edit
# it according to your environment.
